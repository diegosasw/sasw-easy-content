# Focus just on content
One of the good things of markup is that you can focus just on content and worry about styling later.

For instance, each paragraph in markdown will be an html `<p>`.

The links can be defined [like this](https://sunnyatticsoftware.com)

Images can be referenced and displayed like this one ![alt logo here](posts/logo.png).

Another good thing is that you can use github or many other source control repositories to edit content because they usually understand markup. And if you also configure your CI/CD pipeline to automatically deploy changes you can add content to your site without any additional tool.
